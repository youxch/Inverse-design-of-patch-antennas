# Inverse-Design-of-Patch-Antennas

A deep learning approach for the inverse design of patch antennas, aiming to achieve energy-efficient designs and significantly reduce simulation costs in conventional methods.

## Overview

This repository presents a novel inverse design methodology for patch antennas using deep learning techniques. The project encompasses several key components:

- **Data Generation**: Generation of a comprehensive dataset for training the deep learning model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing of the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the network.
- **Network Training & Testing**: Implementation and training of the deep learning model, followed by rigorous testing to validate its performance.
- **Prediction**: Utilization of the trained model to predict optimal patch antenna designs.
- **Inverse Design**: Process of designing patch antennas based on the predictions from the deep learning model.

## Achievements

- **Proposed Method**: A deep learning method is proposed for energy-efficient design of patch antennas.
